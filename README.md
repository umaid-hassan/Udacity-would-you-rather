# Would You Rather Project

This is my second project for the Udacity React Course. The goal of this project was to use everything we have learned up to this point in creating an application
that will allow us recreate the popular would you rather game. Where the user is presented with two options and must pick one. The user can also create their own question and view the leaderboard on who is asking/answering the most questions.

The topics covered in this project are:
* State Management via Redux
* Routing

## Running the Application

To start the application:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Technologies Used

* Node.js
* React
* React Router
* React Redux
* React Bootstrap
